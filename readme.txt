Automatically rename newly uploaded images with AI-generated, descriptive filenames and optional alt text.

== Description ==

Viscribe helps you replace filenames like `IMG_1234.jpg` with more descriptive names based on the actual image content.

The plugin integrates with Groq's Vision API during upload and can:

* generate descriptive filenames for new image uploads,
* optionally save cleaned alt text for the uploaded attachment,
* fall back to the original filename if the AI request fails,
* let you choose supported file types and the Groq vision model,
* support API key handling in the settings UI while also allowing a `wp-config.php`-based setup.

The settings screen is available under **Media → Viscribe**.

= Example =

* Original filename: `IMG_1234.jpg`
* Possible generated filename: `golden-retriever-playing-fetch-park.jpg`

= Supported image types =

* JPEG / JPG
* PNG
* WebP
* GIF

= Security notes =

* The plugin supports storing the Groq API key directly in `wp-config.php` via `VISCRIBE_API_KEY`.
* Saved API keys are encrypted at rest.
* The plugin warns administrators when the encryption key is still stored in the database instead of `wp-config.php`.
* All AJAX requests are protected by capability checks and nonces.

= Developer hooks =

The plugin includes actions and filters for advanced integrations, including upload processing, prompt customization, model lists, file types, and generated filenames.

== Installation ==

= From WordPress.org =

1. Install and activate **Viscribe**.
2. Go to **Media → Viscribe**.
3. Enter your Groq API key.
4. Click **Test Connection**.
5. Save your settings.

= Manual installation =

1. Upload the plugin folder to `/wp-content/plugins/`.
2. Activate the plugin in WordPress.
3. Open **Media → Viscribe**.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Does this rename existing images? =

No. Version 1.0.0 only processes new uploads.

= What happens if Groq is unavailable? =

The upload continues with the original filename.

= Can I store the API key outside the database? =

Yes. Define `VISCRIBE_API_KEY` in `wp-config.php` and the plugin will use that value instead of a saved key.

= Can I also keep the encryption key out of the database? =

Yes. Define `VISCRIBE_ENCRYPTION_KEY` in `wp-config.php`.

= Which file types can be processed? =

JPEG, PNG, WebP, and GIF are supported.

= Does the plugin create alt text? =

It can save a cleaned version of the generated description as the attachment alt text when that option is enabled.
